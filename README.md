Aren't you tired of Windows and programs acting like a teenager leaving everything old all over your drive and taking up unnecessary space? 
  Yeah, me too, so I started doing something about it... this script.

This has been made as an accumulation of years of testing and adding to the script until 
it covered as much "safe to delete" temporary files as possible for the most commonly seen situations.

The target use for this is home and work computers running Windows 7, 8, 10 and very much 11 (no servers)

As such, this is solely based on my experience, so if perhaps you know of something else that I missed
and you would like to see covered in here, shoot me a DM on social media, I'm everywhere.
