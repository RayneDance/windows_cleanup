Aren't you tired of Windows and programs leaving everything old all over your drive and taking up unnecessary space? 
  Yeah, me too, so I started doing something about it... this script.

The target use for this is home and work computers running Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 (no servers)
The idea is to only remove what won't negatively affect a Windows Workstations while reclaiming as much free space as possible.
When it comes to web browser files, I opted to only delete cache, as many users depend on cookies and autofill data.

This has been made as an accumulation of a lot of testing, and adding to the script until 
it covered as much "safe to delete" temporary files as possible for the most commonly seen situations.
This is solely based on my experience, so if perhaps you know of something else that I missed
and you would like to see covered or added in here, shoot me some info here or on social media.
You can find all my socials and contact info on my profile page.
